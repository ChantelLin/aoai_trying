Data exploration: Explore the data to understand its characteristics, patterns, and relationships. This can involve computing summary statistics, examining data distributions, and identifying any outliers or anomalies.\\n\\n4. Data visualization: Create visual representations of the data using graphs, charts, or plots. Visualization helps to better understand the data, identify patterns, and communicate findings effectively.\\n\\n5. Feature engineering: Transform or create new features from the existing data that may enhance the analysis. This can involve feature scaling, encoding categorical variables, or deriving new variables based on domain knowledge.\\n\\n6. Statistical analysis: Apply statistical techniques to analyze relationships, dependencies, or differences between variables. This can include hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, or regression analysis.\\n\\n7. Iterative analysis: Iterate through the previous steps to refine the analysis, explore different angles, and investigate specific questions or hypotheses.\\n\\nThroughout the EDA process, it is important to document findings, make notes, and communicate insights effectively to support further analysis or decision-making.
